# PoliTrack

-This was an application that our team develped at HackPoly 2017!!

What it does
The user can put in their zip code or press a button of their current location to find their local representative. The app will list out the representatives with links to call or email them.

Inspiration
Because of the recent election, people are more on their toes on what is going on in politics. We wanted to make it easy to find our own congressional representative and contact them to give our opinion on current bills.

How we built it
We built the app using Android Studio and the sunlightlabs API.
